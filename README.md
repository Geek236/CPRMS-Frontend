# CPRMS Frontend

Hey bro! Welcome to the **CPRMS Frontend** 😎

This is the React frontend part of the CPRMS project. Setting it up is super easy. Just follow these steps.

---

## Folder Structure

We recommend keeping **frontend** and **backend** together in a common folder like this:

CPRMS/
├─ frontend/
└─ backend/


Copy code

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download / Clone the frontend**

   Put it inside the `CPRMS/frontend` folder (next to your backend).

2. **Install dependencies**

   Open your terminal inside the `frontend` folder and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
This will download and install all the packages your React app needs.

Start the development server

bash
Copy code
npm start
Your app should now be running at http://localhost:3000 🎉

Notes
Make sure your backend is running if your frontend fetches data from it.

Keep your .env files private; don’t push secrets to GitHub.

Your folder structure should stay clean:

bash
Copy code
CPRMS/
  frontend/   # React app
  backend/    # Node.js/Express API
Easy peasy! Your frontend is ready to go 😎
